# MovieLogger API Documentation

## Overview of Application

MovieLogger is a simple, user-friendly app to help movie buffs keep track of everything they've watched or want to watch. Users can log films, rate them, write reviews, add a movie to their list of favourites, and manage what they want to watch.

The application will keep a history of each time a user has watched a movie, along with any review and rating given to the film at that time.

### Glossary

- **Users**: An individual who uses the MovieLogger app. Users can log movies, rate them, write reviews, and add favourites. All users must authenticate to use core features.
- **Movies**: A film entry in the database, containing title, description, release date, and genre. Users interact with movies by logging, rating, reviewing, or favouriting them.
- **Viewings**: A snapshot of an individual movie viewing. This holds the date the user viewed a specific movie, as well as an optional review and score associated with it.
- **Reviews**: A written user review that is associated with a viewing. There is one review per viewing, and a new review would require a new and unique viewing to be logged.
- **Ratings**: A numerical score (e.g., 1â€“10) that a user assigns to a movie they've logged. This is associated with a review.
- **Favourites**: A toggle which a user can apply to a movie to mark it as a personal favourite. This is independent from viewings and is tied directly to a movie.
- **Watchlist**: Movies that have a view date set.
- **Ownership**: A toggle that indicates if a user owns a specific movie. This is independent from viewings and is tied directly to a movie.
