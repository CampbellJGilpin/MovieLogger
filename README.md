# MovieLogger

## Overview of Application

MovieLogger is a simple, user-friendly app to help movie buffs keep track of everything they've watched or want to watch. Users can log films, rate them, write reviews, add a movie to their list of favourites, and manage what they want to watch.

The application will keep a history of each time a user has watched a movie, along with any review and rating given to the film at that time.
